                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>We are a group of writers, Journalists, Engineers and Artists dedicated to telling the truth to the
                    masses via different art forms including memes, sketches, and articles.
                    <br><br>
                    No matter odds, we always believe that truth needs to be said with the loudest voice possible. Therefore
                    we strive to bring it in the form of satire, jokes, rants and in every other form understandable to
                    human beings.
                    <br><br>
    
                    To quote the Verbatim
                    <br><br>
    
                    “If the whole world is telling you, that something wrong is something right.
                    <br><br>
    
                    If the whole world is telling you to move.
                    <br><br>
    
                    It is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree, beside the river of truth, look the entire world in the
                    eye and say,
                    <br><br>
    
                    NO.
                    <br>
    
                    You Move.”</p>
